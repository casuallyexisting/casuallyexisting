- 👋 Hi, I’m @casuallyexisting
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, home automation, and intensive projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about coding a conversational AI with full interfacing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project, really. If you want to help on mine, or need help on yours, I'm happy to oblige!
- 📫 To contact me, open an issue on any of the exo projects! If you would like to work on them, specify that there.
